## Pro Tips

### Before Taking Screenshots

1. **Clean up your task names** - Remove any sensitive/personal info
2. **Have variety** - Mix of different statuses, priorities, due dates
3. **Use real examples** - But keep them generic/professional
4. **Check your theme** - Light or dark mode (dark mode often looks better)

### Screenshot Quality

- **Format**: PNG (automatically done with macOS screenshot)
- **Size**: Raycast window default size is perfect (usually ~1280x800)
- **Clean background**: Use a simple desktop wallpaper or blur it
- **No personal info**: Double-check no sensitive data is visible

**Method 1: Window Capture (RECOMMENDED)**
1. Cmd+Shift+4
2. Press Space (cursor becomes camera)
3. Click Raycast window
4. Screenshot saved to Desktop → Move to metadata/ folder

**Method 2: Selection Capture**
1. Cmd+Shift+4

## Need Help?

If you need to create sample tasks for better screenshots:

1. Create a few test tasks in your Obsidian vault with:
   - Different statuses (todo, in-progress, next)
   - Various priorities (1-urgent, 2-high, 3-medium)
   - Mix of due dates (overdue, today, upcoming)
   - Some with recurrence patterns
   - Different projects

2. Reload hyperDASH in Raycast to see them
