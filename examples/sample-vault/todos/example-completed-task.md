# Example Completed Task

This is an example of a completed task. It will appear in the "Done" view.

## What This Shows
- **Done status** - completed tasks
- **Past due date** - shows you can have historical dates
- Switch to the "Done" view in Hyperdash to see completed tasks

## Try This
1. Switch views using the view selector in Raycast
2. Filter to see only "Done" tasks
3. You can archive or delete old completed tasks to keep your list clean

Completed tasks are filtered out of the default "Todo" view to keep your active task list focused.
