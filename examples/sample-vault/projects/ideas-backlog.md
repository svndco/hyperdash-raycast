# Ideas & Future Projects

A collection of project ideas for the future - when time and energy allow.

## Potential Projects
- Start a blog or newsletter
- Learn a new programming language
- Build a personal dashboard
- Create an automation system for home
- Organize photo library
- Start a side project
- Learn design skills
- Build a reading tracking system

## Someday/Maybe List
This is your backlog of ideas - things you might want to do but aren't ready to commit to yet.

## This Project Shows
- **Someday status** - backlog/ideas
- **Minimal frontmatter** - just tag and status needed
- **No dates** - truly open-ended
- Doesn't show in "Current" view (keeps focus on active work)
- Only shows in "All" projects view

## How to Use This
- Capture ideas here so they're not forgotten
- Review periodically to see if any are ready to activate
- Move items to new projects when ready to start
- Don't feel pressure to do everything!

Keep your someday list realistic and review it during your weekly reviews.
